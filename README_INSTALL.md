# HaxNET---The-PC-Hacking-Simulator
A free, opensource hacking simulator for Windows.

The Basics

Installation
	Installing HaxNET is a fairly simple process. Just download the software (download link at end of manual), unzip the folder from the zip file, open that folder, and run setup.exe
System Requirements:
	OS: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.
	Processor: Any processor released in the past decade should work.
	RAM: About 20 – 50 MB
	Hard Drive Space: About 100 MB
	Other Requirements: .NET Framework 4 or .NET Framework 4.5

First-Time Setup
	When the software is first run, you will be asked if you need instruction. This “instruction” is a very short tutorial that explains the most basic concepts of HaxNET.




	After you have either completed the tutorial or have skipped the tutorial, you will be asked to enter a user name. This username can be as long as you like or as short as you like and can contain any characters. Have fun, be creative!
     Once you have entered your desired username, you will then move on to the default command prompt. At this prompt you can enter in any commands listed in the [help] menu. To access this help menu, just type help at the main command prompt and hit enter.
     In the help menu there is a list of commands:
about
account
clear
clr
connect
datetime
exit
hack
help
mscan
netscan
resetall
tree
tutorial
vol

Next to each of those commands is a small description of what each one does. Here in this manual, we will cover each command in detail.




Commands
About
     The [about] command is used to pull up data about the virtual HaxNET machine you are operating. It displays the following:

HaxNET OS Version
PassCrack Version
VirusTerminator Version
WebProtect Version
Download Speed
Upload Speed

The version of each of these items are very important in the simulation.

Account
     This command displays the account number of your machine (which actually is your virtual IP address) and the amount of bitcoins on your machine. Bitcoins is the virtual in-game currency. You can use bitcoins to purchase upgrades for your OS, Firewall, Hack tool, Download Speed, and Upload Speed. You obtain bitcoins by exploiting them from other machines on the HaxNET network.

Clear and Clr
     Both the clear and clr commands serve the same purpose. They both clear the prompt of clutter. All they do is wipe what is on the screen and set it back to nothing but the prompt. Do not worry, these commands do not wipe any save data or important information from your HaxNET virtual machine.

Connect
     The connect command allows you to connect to either the Micronoft Store or the BlackNet Market (Micronoft was not a typo, just so you know). Using this command is somewhat different than just a normal command. This command uses arguments. Arguments are additional words or phrases that get passed to the command to be processed. To use arguments with this command just type the command, then the argument after it. For example:
<YOURUSERNAME>@hax.net>connect –h
After you press enter, the [-h] argument will be passed to the connect command. There are three arguments to this command:
blacknet
-h
micronoft

If you type the [connect] argument and [blacknet] you will connect to the BlackNet Market, if with the [connect] argument and [micronoft] you will connect to the Micronoft Store, and if you type the [connect] argument and  [-h] you will get the help menu displayed to you.

DateTime
     The datetime command displays the current date time.

Exit
     The exit command quits the NaxNET simulation. Note: before the program completely shuts down, all changes/events that have taken place are saved.

Hack
     The hack command, like the connect command, uses arguments for it to operate. Hack command, however, differs greatly from the connect command. The hack command has only one preset argument and a variable argument. The preset argument is:
-h
And the variable argument is any IP address that you wish to exploit. For example:
<YOURUSERNAME>@hax.net>hack 12.345.678.900
It is recommended to first use the netscan command before typing in any IP address (see next page for info on the netscan command).


Mscan
     The mscan command scans your HaxNET machine for viruses. Viruses, if you have a lot of them, will cause the prompt to react to commands very slowly…depending on how many viruses you have. Mscan will scan for and ask if you want to remove the viruses from the machine.

Netscan
     The netscan command will scan the HaxNET network for other machines with the same firewall level equal to your hack tool level (or some level that’s within reason). That’s why using this tool before using the hack command is recommended, because you might try to break into a pc with a firewall level too high for your hack tool. Netscan, when entered, will display a few IP addresses along with their respected firewall levels.

Resetall
     The resetall command will delete all your saves and you will have to restart the game from the beginning. Before deleting, however, you will be asked if you’re sure if you want to proceed with deleting the saves.

Tree
	The tree command displays all the files on your HaxNET machine.

Tutorial
	The tutorial command will display the tutorial that was shown at the beginning of the game when you first started.

Vol
	The vol command displays info about the hard drive in your HaxNET machine: the drive number and the amount of space used.
